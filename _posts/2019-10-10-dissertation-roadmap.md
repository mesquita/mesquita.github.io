### Documenting every step along the way

---------------------------

#### First step

Choosing a general area (the theme, the subject, you get it) which is: telecommunications, 5G, Multiple Access Techniques, NOMA (Non Orthogonal Multiple Access).

Taking a course on the subject: Wireless Systems. 

Reading about it: Multiple Access Techniques for 5G Wireless Networks and Beyond. Mojtaba Vaezi, Zhiguo Ding, H. Vincent Poor. Springer.

The goal is choose simulate some NOMA related techniques and develop more on some specific topic.

(I'm going to write it better later.)
